# Primer Setup

## Overview

One-time guided setup for the AI Primer workflow. Designed for users who may have never opened a terminal. Progressive: present one step at a time, confirm before acting, verify after each change. Idempotent: detect what is already installed and skip completed steps. Safe to re-run at any point — nothing gets duplicated or overwritten.

This skill complements the AI Primer guidebook (Parts 2-3) and prepares the user's machine with every tool, connection, and configuration needed to build and ship full-stack products with Claude.

---

## Design Principles

Five principles govern how this setup operates. Follow all of them throughout the process.

### Never assume terminal familiarity

Explain every concept in plain English before executing any command. When a command runs, describe what it does and what the output means. Treat the terminal as a new environment the user is seeing for the first time. Avoid jargon; when technical terms are unavoidable, define them immediately.

### One step at a time

Present a single action, explain it, ask permission, execute it, verify the result, then move on. Never batch multiple installs into one step. Never run ahead while the user is still absorbing the previous result. Patience is the default.

### Idempotent

Detect what is already installed, configured, and working. Skip those steps entirely with a brief confirmation: "Git is already installed and configured — moving on." If something is installed but broken, fix it rather than re-installing. If something is partially configured, complete the configuration rather than starting over.

### Honest

Clearly distinguish what Claude handles automatically from what requires the user to act. Account creation, OAuth flows, and browser-based sign-ins cannot be completed by Claude — say so plainly. Never pretend to do something that requires human interaction. State what will happen, what the user needs to do, and when to come back.

### Platform-aware

Detect the operating system first and tailor every instruction accordingly. Mac-first instructions with Windows and Linux alternatives where relevant. Consult `references/environment-checks.md` for platform-specific detection commands and expected outputs.

---

## Setup Flow

Work through these steps in order. Step 0 must pass before anything else — it catches system-level issues that cause cascading failures if not addressed upfront. Remaining steps include detection logic to skip work that is already done.

### Step 0: System Health Check

Before installing anything, verify the system is ready. Run all checks from `references/system-health-checks.md` and present results as a clear pass/fail list. Example:

```
System health check:

  [pass] Admin access — your account can install software
  [pass] Temp directory — writable at /var/folders/k5/.../T/
  [pass] Home directory — writable
  [pass] Network — GitHub, npm, and Cloudflare are reachable
  [pass] Disk space — 45GB free
  [info] Shell — zsh (profile: ~/.zshrc)
  [info] macOS 15.3
```

**If any blocker fails**, stop here. Do not proceed to tool installation — it will fail. Explain the specific issue in plain English, provide the fix from the reference file, and ask the user to resolve it before continuing. The most common blocker is a fresh user account that needs a Mac restart.

**If all blockers pass**, move on. Warnings and informational items can be noted without stopping.

### Step 1: Workspace Check

Detect the current working directory. Evaluate whether it is an appropriate workspace location.

If the user is in their home directory, Downloads, Desktop, or another unexpected location, explain the workspace convention: `~/Development` is a single folder where all projects live. It is the place to always launch Claude from. Having one consistent workspace means Claude can see all projects and understand the full development environment. Every project created during the primer will live inside this folder.

If `~/Development` does not exist, offer to create it. Explain what the `mkdir` command does before running it — it creates a new folder, nothing more. Guide the user to navigate into `~/Development` before proceeding with the rest of setup.

If the user is already in `~/Development` or a subdirectory of it, confirm the location and move on.

### Step 2: Environment Detection

Run detection commands from `references/environment-checks.md` to survey the current state of the machine. Check all of the following:

- Operating system (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
- Node.js — installed and version is v18 or higher
- npm — installed (ships with Node.js)
- Git — installed and global user.name/user.email configured
- Homebrew — installed (macOS only)
- Wrangler — installed
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) — installed

Present findings in plain English. Use a clear list showing what is ready and what is missing or needs configuration. Example format:

```
Here is what I found on your system:

  [check] Node.js v22.4.1 — ready
  [check] npm 10.8.1 — ready
  [check] Git 2.43.0 — installed, but name and email not configured
  [x] Homebrew — not found
  [x] Wrangler — not found
  [x] GitHub CLI — not found
```

This step is diagnostic only. Make no changes yet. Let the user absorb the picture before proceeding.

### Step 3: Account Verification

The guidebook directs users to create three accounts before running this skill: Claude, Cloudflare, and GitHub. Since the user is already running Claude Code, their Claude account is working. This step verifies the other two.

At this stage, `wrangler` and `gh` are likely not installed yet, so tool-based checks may not be available. Simply ask:

"The primer asks you to create Cloudflare and GitHub accounts before this step. Do you have both set up? And did you enable R2 Object Storage in your Cloudflare dashboard?"

If yes to all, confirm and move on. The accounts will be connected to the terminal in Step 5, after the necessary tools are installed.

If no, pause and walk them through creating the missing account(s):

- **Cloudflare:** "Open **https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up** — it's free and takes about two minutes. Let me know when you're done."
- **R2 enablement:** "In your Cloudflare dashboard, click **R2 Object Storage** in the left sidebar and follow the activation steps. This requires a credit card on file, but the free tier is generous — 10GB storage at no charge."
- **GitHub:** "Open **https://github.com/signup** — also free, also two minutes. Remember the email you use. Let me know when you're done."

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 4: Tool Installation

Work through missing tools one at a time. Skip anything already present and working. For each missing tool, follow this exact sequence:

1. Explain what it is and why it is needed, in one plain-English sentence
2. Show the command that will run and describe what it does
3. Ask permission before executing
4. Install using the platform-appropriate method from `references/environment-checks.md`
5. Verify installation succeeded by running the check command and confirming the output
6. Celebrate briefly — "Node.js is installed and ready" — before moving on

**Installation order:** Homebrew first (macOS, if missing), then Node.js, then Git, then GitHub CLI, then Wrangler. This order matters because later tools depend on earlier ones — Wrangler requires npm, which comes with Node.js, which on Mac is easiest to install through Homebrew.

**Tool explanations to use:**

- **Homebrew** — "A package manager for Mac. It installs developer tools with a single command instead of downloading installers from websites."
- **Node.js** — "The engine that runs JavaScript outside a browser. Nearly every web development tool depends on it."
- **Git** — "Version control. It tracks every change to your code so nothing is ever lost and you can always undo mistakes."
- **GitHub CLI** — "The command-line tool for GitHub. It lets Claude create repositories, push your code, and manage your projects."
  - **Mac:** `brew install gh`
  - **Linux:** Follow the instructions at https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md
  - **Windows:** `winget install --id GitHub.cli`
- **Wrangler** — "The Cloudflare command-line tool. It deploys your projects to the internet."

**Git configuration:** After confirming Git is installed, check whether `user.name` and `user.email` are configured globally. If either is missing, ask the user for their name and email address. Remind them: "Use the same email you used for GitHub — this links your code changes to your GitHub profile." Configure with `git config --global`. Explain: "Git labels every change with your name and email — think of it as signing your work."

**Git default branch:** Set the default branch name to `main` (the modern standard). Without this, Git defaults to `master` on fresh installs:
```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

**Git HTTPS preference:** Also configure Git to use HTTPS instead of SSH for GitHub. This prevents authentication errors when installing plugins and cloning repositories, since most beginners do not have SSH keys set up:
```bash
git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf "git@github.com:"
```
Both of these are silent, one-time configurations. No explanation is needed unless the user asks — just run them as part of Git setup.

If any installation fails, consult `references/troubleshooting.md` for the specific error symptom before attempting alternative approaches.

### Step 5: Account Connections

Connect the user's Cloudflare and GitHub accounts to the terminal tools installed in Step 4. Both connections are required.

**GitHub authentication:**

Check with `gh auth status`. If not authenticated:

"Now let's connect GitHub to your terminal. I'll start the login process — a browser window will open where you'll sign in to GitHub and authorize the connection."

Run `gh auth login`. Walk the user through the interactive prompts:
- Select **GitHub.com**
- Select **HTTPS** as the preferred protocol
- When asked to authenticate, choose **Login with a web browser**
- Follow the browser prompts to authorize

Verify with `gh auth status`. If it shows the user's GitHub username, confirm: "GitHub is connected as [username]."

**Cloudflare authentication:**

Check with `wrangler whoami`. If not authenticated:

"Now let's connect Cloudflare. A browser window will open — sign in with your Cloudflare account and click 'Allow'."

Important: The `wrangler login` command has a built-in timeout. Since the user already has an account, this should be quick. If the user hasn't created an account yet, direct them to dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up first.

Run `wrangler login` with a 3-minute timeout. After the user confirms the OAuth flow is complete, verify with `wrangler whoami`.

If the login timed out, offer to try again. If verification fails, consult `references/troubleshooting.md` for authentication issues.

### Step 6: MCP Server Configuration

Install MCP servers using `claude mcp add` CLI commands. These write to `~/.claude.json` and persist across all sessions automatically. Consult `references/mcp-server-configs.md` for exact commands.

**Required — install both:**

- **context7** — "This lets me pull the latest documentation for any library instead of relying on potentially outdated training data." Run: `claude mcp add --scope user context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest`

- **Cloudflare** — "This lets me search Cloudflare docs and help manage your cloud services directly." Run: `claude mcp add --transport http --scope user cloudflare https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp`. Authentication happens automatically via OAuth the first time it is used — no separate login needed. **Important:** When the OAuth authorization page appears in the browser, it shows three permission levels: Read Only (default), Workers Full Access, and DNS Full Access. Tell the user: "When the Cloudflare authorization page opens, **click 'Workers Full Access'** before clicking Allow. The default is Read Only, which won't let me create or manage your projects."

**Optional:**

- **Figma** — Ask: "Do you use Figma for design? If so, I can connect to your Figma files and generate code from your designs." If yes, run: `claude mcp add --transport http --scope user figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`. After installing, the user will need to authenticate via `/mcp` inside Claude Code on next restart. If no, skip.

Verify with `claude mcp list` to confirm context7 and cloudflare appear.

### Step 7: Marketplace Plugin Installation

Install plugins from the official Anthropic marketplace. The user needs to first add the marketplace, then install plugins from it. These are slash commands the user must type directly — they cannot be run via bash because they have interactive prompts.

Tell the user: "I need you to type a few commands to install plugins. These are slash commands — type them exactly as shown, starting with the `/`. For each one, when it asks about install scope, choose 'Install for you (user scope)'. After all three are installed, just type 'all done' or 'done' and I'll take it from there."

**First, add the official marketplace:**
```
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
```

**Then install each plugin, one at a time:**

1. **Playwright** — "This lets me open a browser, test your app, and debug issues autonomously — when something looks wrong, I can see what you see."
   ```
   /plugin install playwright@claude-plugins-official
   ```
   Choose "Install for you (user scope)".

2. **frontend-design** — "This teaches me UI/UX patterns and helps me build better-looking interfaces."
   ```
   /plugin install frontend-design@claude-plugins-official
   ```
   Choose "Install for you (user scope)".

3. **superpowers** — "This gives me enhanced workflow skills — brainstorming, debugging, planning, and more."
   ```
   /plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
   ```
   Choose "Install for you (user scope)".

After all three are installed, run `npx playwright install` to download browser binaries. Note this download may take a few minutes.

Explain the concept behind plugins and skills: "Skills are playbooks that teach me specific workflows. Without them, I am a generalist. With them, I know your preferred workflow and can be more effective at each part of building — from brainstorming to debugging to deployment."

### Step 8: Model Selection

Claude Code defaults to Sonnet 4.6 on Pro plans. Opus 4.6 is significantly more capable — it reasons more deeply, catches more edge cases, and handles complex multi-file changes with far fewer mistakes. For non-coders especially, this matters: Opus is less likely to produce subtle bugs that you wouldn't know how to catch or fix yourself. The difference is not small.

This step requires the user to type a slash command, like the plugin installs.

Tell the user:

"One more important setting. Claude Code may be using Sonnet as its default model, but this guide is built around **Opus 4.6** — it's substantially more capable, especially for people who aren't reviewing every line of code themselves. Opus makes fewer mistakes, handles complexity better, and is less likely to get stuck in loops. I strongly recommend switching to it now."

"Type `/model` and use the arrow keys to select **Opus 4.6**, then press Enter."

```
/model
```

After the user confirms they've selected Opus, acknowledge and move on: "Great — Opus 4.6 is the best model for this workflow. Claude will remember your preference."

If the user says Opus isn't showing as an option, suggest they check their plan — Opus should be available on both Pro and Max. If they're hitting usage limits frequently, mention that Max ($100/mo) gives more capacity, but Pro is fine for getting started.

### Step 9: Completion Summary

Present a clear checklist of everything that was set up, using checkmarks for completed items. Include the tool versions where relevant. Include account connections:

```
Accounts:
  [check] GitHub — connected as [username]
  [check] Cloudflare — connected as [account name]

Tools:
  [check] Node.js v22.x
  [check] Git — configured as [name] <[email]>
  [check] GitHub CLI
  [check] Wrangler

MCP Servers:
  [check] context7
  [check] Cloudflare

Plugins:
  [check] Playwright (with browsers)
  [check] frontend-design
  [check] superpowers
```

Tell the user to restart Claude to pick up the new configuration: "To restart, type `/exit` (or press Ctrl+C), then type `claude` to start a fresh session. This is like refreshing a browser — Claude picks up all the new tools and plugins when it starts fresh."

Remind the user how to start their first project: "After restarting, type `/a-new-project` to create your first project."

Suggest optional upgrades that are not required but can improve the experience:

- **Ghostty** — "A faster, cleaner terminal app for Mac. Free. Download from ghostty.org."
- **VS Code** — "A code editor for reading what Claude builds. Free. Download from code.visualstudio.com. Not required, but helpful for understanding your project over time."

Congratulate briefly and orient toward next steps. Keep it short — the user is ready to build, and the best way to learn is by doing.

## Troubleshooting

If any step fails during setup, consult `references/troubleshooting.md` for the specific symptom before trying alternative approaches. The troubleshooting reference is organized by symptom — match the error message or behavior to the corresponding entry for the targeted fix.

Common categories covered:

- "Command not found" errors after installation
- Permission errors during global npm installs
- Wrangler and GitHub authentication failures
- MCP server configuration issues
- MCP server re-authorization (expired tokens)
- Port conflicts

## Reference Files

Four reference files support this skill. Load them as needed during setup.

- `references/system-health-checks.md` — System-level diagnostics that must pass before any installation. Use during Step 0 (health check). Covers admin access, temp directory permissions, write access, network connectivity, disk space, and shell detection.
- `references/environment-checks.md` — Platform-specific commands for detecting installed tools and configurations. Use during Step 2 (detection) and Step 4 (installation verification).
- `references/mcp-server-configs.md` — Exact configurations and install commands for MCP servers and plugins. Use during Step 6 (MCP setup) and Step 7 (plugin installation).
- `references/troubleshooting.md` — Symptom-based troubleshooting for common setup issues. Consult whenever an installation or configuration step fails.
